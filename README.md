# Book Recommendation Project

## About the project

The purpose of this project is to create a book recommendation system
using **Machine Learning** algorithms.

The data of the books is took from a dataset of books. The file *books.csv* include the data.

This is still **ongoing project**.

## About the dataset

The dataset contain information of more than 45,000 books. every book have information like **number of pages, publication date, average rating,
total amount of rating** and more

## Example of ML algorithms that i used


### KNN algorithm
### `2764 struct run`

Represents a memory page.  
A `run` points to the next available page/`run` (which is actually the *previous* page, because the first available is the last in the memory).

### K-means

### PCA
